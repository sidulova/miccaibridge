  <p>
    There is a surge of new AI models and methods, yet many are adopted in healthcare without fully assessing their impact on patient safety and outcomes. Without alignment between innovation, evaluation, and regulation, these technologies risk remaining confined to research and never reaching clinical practice. We therefore need rigorous evaluation frameworks and effective regulatory processes to ensure AI in healthcare is safe, reliable, and deployment-ready.

    If you are working on research related to AI safety, clinical deployment, or evaluation and regulation frameworks, then:
